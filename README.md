- 👋 Hi, I’m @elisackelly, you can call me Elisa!

- 🌱 I’m currently a student, studying Operations Research Engineering at Cornell University, while also teaching myself front end web development for fun!

- 👀 I’m interested in learning, always! Currently I am exploring different sectors of the tech industry and hoping to find which on I'm currently passionate about exploring various sectors within the tech industry.

- 🌐 I believe in the power of technology to transform and shape our world. From software development and data science to artificial intelligence and UX/UI design , I'm eager to delve into different areas and gain hands-on experience.

- 💡 I find joy in learning about cutting-edge technologies and applying them to real-world problems. As an avid learner, I'm constantly expanding my skill set and keeping up with the latest industry trends.

- 🏐 When I'm not coding, researching, working part-time, or juggling the many other tasks of a university student, you can find me on the volleyball court. I'm still a beginner, but since I started in February of this year, I have experienced tremendous growth as a player. Each practice has allowed me to gain new skills and begin honing them, and I can feel myself getting better with each session.

- Playing volleyball not only increases physical activity but also improves mental health. The combination of teamwork, strategic thinking, and physical exertion is invigorating and helps me stay balanced and focused.

- ✏️ In addition to sports and technology, I also have a passion for drawing and painting. Exploring different mediums for creativity is something I thoroughly enjoy. From pencil sketches to digital art, I love experimenting with various techniques and bringing my imagination to life on paper or screen.

- 📺 I also enjoy watching anime and reading manga and Webtoons. The stories, art, and characters captivate me, and I'm always eager to discuss my favorite series and discover new ones.

- 🍳 In my free time, I love to unleash my creativity in the kitchen. Cooking and baking have become a delightful hobby, allowing me to connect my cuban 🇨🇺 roots, experiment with a veriety of flavors from all over the world, and share all of the delicious food with friends and family.

- 🤞 Over the summer I will be working on some research in my university's Operations Research department and embarking on some side projects. If everything goes well 🤞, my side projects will be posted here by the end of the summer. 

- 🚀 Collaborations and opportunities to work on exciting projects that contribute to the advancement of technology are always welcome! Together, we can learn, grow, and make a positive impact.
